* Keywords
  * When ML Works, Bias Variance


* Main Points

** Generalisation
   * Need to understand the importance of performance on unseen data
   * Understand that fitting well on the training set doesn't
     guarantee good generalisation


** Bias-Variance Dilemms
   * Need to understand this is a thought experiment
   * Bias: generalisation of mean machine
   * Variance: expected variation of a particular machine from the
     mean machine
   * Expected Variance = Bias + Variance
     * Need to be able to derive this result
   * Dilemma
     * Simple machine are likely to have high bias
     * Complex machines are likely to have high variance
