\section{Bayesian Inference Gets Hard}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We saw that in some cases if we had a simple likelihood (normal,
    binomial, Poisson, multinomial) you can choose a conjugate prior
    (gamma-normal/Wishart, beta, gamma, Dirchlet) so that the posterior
    has the same form as the prior\pause
  \item Very often we are working with more complex models where no
    conjugate prior exists\pause
  \item The posterior is not described by a known distribution\pause
  \item We have to work a lot harder---particularly with multivariate
    distributions\pause
  \end{itemize}

\section{Bayesian Inference}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Recall our problem is that we are given some data
    $\data$\pause
  \item Our posterior is given by
    \begin{align*}
      \Prob{\bm{\theta}|\data} &= \frac{\Prob{\data|\bm{\theta}} \,
                                 \Prob{\bm{\theta}}}{ \Prob{\data} } &
      &\text{or}&
      f\brackets{\bm{\theta}|\data} &= \frac{f\brackets{\data|\bm{\theta}} \,
                                 f\brackets{\bm{\theta}}}{ f\brackets{\data} }
    \end{align*}
  \item Where $\bm{\theta}$ are the parameters we are trying to infer\pause
  \item But our likelihood (and/or prior) might be quite
    complicated\pause
  \item Typically we don't have a closed form representation for our
    posterior distibution\pause
  \end{itemize}

\section{Histograms, Samples and Means}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We could represent our posterior as a histogram, although for
    multivariate distributions (i.e. when we are modelling more than one
    variable) a histogram can be unwieldy\pause
  \item A sample from the posterior distribution is often sufficient
    e.g. in our topic models (LDA) a typical set of topics is what we
    are after\pause
  \item However, when samples vary a lot, often the most useful quantities
    are expectation, e.g.
    \begin{align*}
      &\av{\bm{\Theta}} & &\av{\Theta_i^2}-\av{\Theta_i}^2 \\
      &\av{\Theta_i\,\Theta_j} - \av{\Theta_i}\,\av{\Theta_j}
      && \av{\bm{\Theta}\,\bm{\Theta}^\tr} -\av{\bm{\Theta}}\,\av{\bm{\Theta}}^\tr\pause
    \end{align*}

\section[-2]{Sample Estimation}

\pb\pause\pauselevel{=1}
\begin{itemize}
\item If we can draw independent \emph{deviates} (aka
  \emph{variates}), $\bm{\Theta}_i$, from our posterior distribution then we can
  obtain an estimate of our expectation
  \begin{align*}
    \av{g(\bm{\Theta})} \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n g(\bm{\Theta}_i)\pauseh
  \end{align*}
\item Provided our posterior distribution is well behaved the
  relative error in our estimate will drop off as $1/\sqrt{n}$\pauseh

\section{Rejection Method}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The transformation method only works when we can easily compute
    the inverse \textit{cumulative distribution function} (CDF)\pause
  \item A more general technique is the rejection method where we
    generate deviates from $g_Y(y)$ such that $c\,g_Y(x)\geq f_X(x)$\pause
  \item To draw deviates from $f_X(x)$ we draw a deviate $Y\sim g_Y$ and
    then accept the deviate with probability $f_X(Y)/(c\,g_Y(Y))$\pause
  \item The expected rejection rate is $c-1$\pause
  \item Need to choose a good distribution $g_Y(y)$\pause

\section{Problems with Rejection}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The rejection method is very general and often the method of
    choice (although for normal deviates there is a clever
    transformation method which is faster)\pause
  \item However, for complicated probability distributions it can be
    difficult to find a good proposal distribution $g_Y(y)$\pause
  \item This is particular true for multivariate distributions\pause
  \item If the proposal distribution is poor $c$ might be very high and
    the number of rejections is stupidly high\pause

\section{Detailed Balance}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose we have a set of states $\mathcal{S}$ and want to draw
    sample from a probability distribution $\bm{\pi} = (\pi_i | i \in
    \mathcal{S})$\pause
  \item If we choose a transition probability $M_{ij}$ from state $j$ to
    state $i$ such that
    \begin{align*}
      M_{ij} \, \pi_j = M_{ji} \pi_i
    \end{align*}
  \item Then (with mild conditions on $M_{ij}$) if we start from any
    state, eventually, the probability of being in state $i$ is
    $\pi_i$\pause
  \item This condition is known as \emph{detailed balance}\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section{Metropolis Algorithm}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A very easy way to achieve detailed balance is starting from
    state $j$ choose a ``neighbouring'' state, $i$ with equal
    probability\pause
  \item We accept the move if either
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\pi_i>\pi_j$ or
    \item we make the move with a probability $\pi_i/\pi_j$\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Note that we require the state $i$ to have the same number of
    neighbours as state $j$ so that detailed balance is satisfied\pause
  \item This is the basis of \emph{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section{Continuous Variables}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If we are working with continuous variables $\bm{\theta}$ then
    the equation for detailed balance for the transition probability
    $W(\bm{\theta}\rightarrow \bm{\theta}')$ is
    \begin{align*}
      W(\bm{\theta}\rightarrow \bm{\theta}')\, \pi(\bm{\theta}) =
      W(\bm{\theta}'\rightarrow \bm{\theta})\, \pi(\bm{\theta}') \pause
    \end{align*}
  \item where $\pi(\bm{\theta})$ is the probability distribution we wish
    to sample from\pause
  \item The update rule is to choose a nearby value $\bm{\theta}'$,
    compute $r = \pi(\bm{\theta}')/\pi(\bm{\theta})$ and accept the
    update with probability $\min(1,r)$\pause
  \item We require that the probability of choosing $\bm{\theta}$ from
    $\bm{\theta}'$ is the same as the reverse\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section{What Makes MCMC Nice}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Because we are free to choose where we move (and choose close
    by neighbours) $\pi(\bm{\theta}') \approx \pi(\bm{\theta})$ so that moves are not too
    infrequent\pause
  \item Also very importantly the updates depend only on the ratio
    $\pi(\bm{\theta}')/\pi(\bm{\theta})$\pause
  \item We only need to know our probabilities up to a multiplicative
    scaling factor\pause
  \item For sampling from the posterior we only need to know the
    likelihood and prior $\Prob{\data| \bm{\theta}}\,\Prob{\bm{\theta}}$\pause{}
    (or $f(\data| \bm{\theta})\,f(\bm{\theta})$)\pauseb
  \item We don't need to know $\Prob{\data}$ which we generally don't
    know\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section{What Makes MCMC Nasty}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It can take a long time until our states occur with the
    probability $\bm{\pi}$ (i.e. we have forgotten our initial
    state)\pause
  \item We don't even know how long we have to wait\pause
  \item Even when we have reached this \textit{equilibration time} each
    sample is correlated with the previous sample\pause
  \item To get a good approximation to the posterior expectation
    requires running for many times the equilibration time\pause
  \item Note, if we are just finding sample averages then we can use all
    samples after equilibrating even if they are not independent\pause

\section[-2]{Proposals and Metropolis-Hastings}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have some freedom in choosing a new proposal $\bm{\theta}'$
    from our current position $\bm{\theta}$---a good choice can increase
    the acceptance rate making the MCMC more efficient\pause
  \item We define the proposal distribution
    $p(\bm{\theta}'|\bm{\theta})$\pause
  \item For the standard Metropolis algorithm to work we require
    $p(\bm{\theta}'|\bm{\theta}) = p(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\theta}')$\pause
  \item In some cases (e.g when $\theta_i\geq 0$) this can be hard to
    achieve\pause
  \item We can modify our update rule to accept a move with probability
    \begin{align*}
      \min\left(1, \frac{p(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\theta}')\,f(\data|
      \bm{\theta}')\,f(\bm{\theta}')}{p(\bm{\theta}'|\bm{\theta})\,f(\data|
      \bm{\theta})\,f(\bm{\theta})}\right)\pause

\section[-2]{Traffic Rate}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Consider monitoring the flow of traffic where we have data
    \begin{align*}
      \data = (N_1,\,N_2,\,\ldots,\, N_n)
    \end{align*}
    where $N_i$ is the number of car that past on day $i$\pause
  \item We assume $N_i\sim\mathrm{Poi}(\mu)$ and want to infer
    $\mu$\pause
  \item The Poisson distribution has a beta conjugate prior\pause
  \item We don't have any prior knowledge on $\mu$ so we use a
    non-informative prior $\mathrm{Gam}(\mu|0,0)=1/\mu$\pause
  \item Note that we can solve this problem exactly---however, lets
    compare with MCMC\pause

\section[-2]{Proposal Distribution}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If we can choose our proposal distribution $p(\mu'|\mu)$ to be
    close to the posterior distribution then our acceptance rate would
    be close to 1\pause
  \item We choose $p(\mu'|\mu) = \mathrm{Gam}(\mu'|\mu,\mu^2)$ which has
    $\av{\mu'}=\mu$ and variance 1\pause
  \item We update with probability $\min(1,r)$ where
  \begin{align*}
    r &= \frac{\mathrm{Gam}(\mu|\mu^{\prime2},\mu')
        \tfrac{1}{\mu'} \prod_{i=1}^n \mathrm{Poi}(N_i|\mu')}
        {\mathrm{Gam}(\mu'|\mu^2,\mu) \tfrac{1}{\mu}
        \prod_{i=1}^n \mathrm{Poi}(N_i|\mu)}\pause
    \\
      &= \frac{\mu\,\mathrm{Gam}(\mu|\mu^{\prime2},\mu')}
        {\mu'\,\mathrm{Gam}(\mu'|\mu^2,\mu)}
        \e{- n (\mu'-\mu) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n N_i \logg{
        \frac{\mu'}{\mu}}}\pause

\section{MCMC Details}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To compute correct histograms you need to count samples where no
    move is made multiple times\pause
  \item On modern computers its quite quick to compute millions of
    samples\pause
  \item The code is not very difficult to write (although care is need
    to get everything correct)\pause
  \item This can be used on complicated problems such as topic models
    (LDA) with thousands of parameters\pause
  \item The accuracy of MCMC is slow if it takes a long time to sample
    the posterior distribution\pause

\section{The MCMC Industry}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MCMC provides a means to accurately sample from very complex
    models\pause
  \item There have been many advanced techniques developed to improve
    MCMC performance\pause
  \item E.g. hybrid MCMC simulates a dynamics to find good proposals
    with similar probability far from the starting point\pause
  \item Often it seems that MCMC is complicated because there are so
    many optimisations, but often simple implementations are
    sufficient\pause

\section{MAP Solutions}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The simplest alternative to MCMC is to find a set of parameters
    $\bm{\theta}$ that maximise $f(\data|\bm{\theta})\,
    f(\bm{\theta})$\pause
  \item This is the Maximum Aposteriori (MAP) approximation\pause
  \item It can give good results if the posterior is unimodal and fairly
    well concentrated\pause
  \item However, you are throwing away most of the probabilistic
    information\pause
  \item In full Bayes (using MCMC) you can, for example, measure your
    uncertainty which MAP doesn't let you do\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section[-2]{Variational Methods}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A second method is to approximate the posterior distribution by
    a simpler (typically factored distribution)
    \begin{align*}
      f(\bm{\theta}|\data) \approx g(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\phi}) = \prod_i
      g(\theta_i|\phi_i)\pause
    \end{align*}
  \item We then choose $\bm{\phi}$ to minimise the ``distance'' between
    our distribution and the true posterior
    \begin{align*}
      \mathrm{KL}\brackets{ g(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\phi}) \big\|
      f(\bm{\theta}|\data) }\pause
    \end{align*}
  \item Where $\mathrm{KL}(g \| f)$ is the \textit{Kullback-Leibler (KL)
      divergence}
    \begin{align*}
      \mathrm{KL}(g \| f) = \int g(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\phi}) \, 
      \logg{ \frac{f(\bm{\theta}|\data)}{g(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\phi})} } \,
      \dd \bm{\theta}\pause

\section{KL-divergence}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The KL-divergence satisfies
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathrm{KL}(g \| f) \geq 0$
    \item $\mathrm{KL}(f \| f) = 0$\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item It acts as a measure of the difference between probability
    distributions although $\mathrm{KL}(g \| f) \neq \mathrm{KL}(f \|
    g)$\pause
  \item We therefore choose $g(\bm{\theta}|\bm{\phi})$ to minimise
    $\mathrm{KL}(g \| f)$\pause
  \item This is a bit technical (I skip all details), but often results
    in quite neat algorithms that are far faster than MCMC although
    approximate\pause

\section{Variational versus MCMC}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Variational approximations have an elegance\pause
  \item They can produce good answers (although not always)\pause
  \item They can be extended (e.g. by minimising $\mathrm{KL}(f \| g)$
    rather than $\mathrm{KL}(g \| f)$---this is known as\textit{ belief
      propagation})\pause
  \item MCMC is less elegant, but is a controlled approximation (we get
    better results by increasing the number of iterations)\pause
  \item MCMC is slower, but on modern computers this isn't usually a
    problem\pause

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item As soon as we use complex models we are no longer able to
    compute the posterior in closed form\pause
  \item Monte Carlo techniques and particularly MCMC are a very general
    method for computing samples from the posterior\pause
  \item These techniques have been highly developed, but very frequently
    even simple implementations are sufficient to do good
    inference\pause
  \item Variational methods provide an approximate closed form solution
    to problems with complex likelihoods\pause
  \item Variational methods are mathematically challenging, but are
    potentially far faster to compute than MCMC\pause
