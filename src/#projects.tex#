  \begin{enumerate}\squeeze
  \item Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to
    a manageable size if necessary)\pause
  \item Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data
    exploration\pause
  \item Study each attribute and its characteristics:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Name
    \item Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text,
      structured, etc)
    \item Number of missing values

  \section[-2]{4. Prepare the Data}

  \item Notes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset
      intact)\pause
    \item Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for
      five reasons:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a
        fresh dataset
      \item So you can apply these transformations in future project
      \item To clean and prepare the test set
      \item To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution
        is live
      \item To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as
        hyperparameters\pause
      \end{itemize}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Data cleaning
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix or remove outliers (optional)
    \item Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or
      drop their rows (or columns)\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Feature selection (optional):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for
      the task\pause
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Discretize continuous features
    \item Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.)
    \item Add promising transformations of features (e.g., $\log(x)$,
      $\sqrt{x}$, $x^2$, $\e{x}$ , etc.)\pause
    \item Aggregate features into promising new features\pause

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
  \section[-2]{5. Short-List Promising Models}

\begin{PauseHighLight}
  \begin{enumerate}\squeeze
  \item Train many quick and dirty models from different categories
    (e.g., linear, naiveBayes, SVM, Random Forests, neural net, etc.)
    using standard parameters\pause 
  \item Measure and compare their performance
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the
      mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N
      folds\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Analyse the most significant variables for each
    algorithm\pause
  \item Analyse the types of errors the models make
    \begin{itemize}
    \item What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Have a quick round of feature selection and engineering\pause
  \item Have one or two more quick iterations of the five previous
    steps\pause
  \item Short-list the top three to five most promising models,
    preferring models that make different types of errors\pause
  \end{enumerate}
\end{PauseHighLight}


\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section[-2]{6. Fine-Tune the System}

\begin{PauseHighLight}\squeeze
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Notes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You will want to use as much data as possible for this step,
      especially as you move toward the end of fine-tuning
    \item As always automate what you can\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters,
      especially when you are not sure about them (e.g., should I
      replace missing values with zero or with the median value? Or
      just drop the rows?)
    \item Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore,
      prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long,
      you may prefer a Bayesian optimisation approach\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often
    perform better than running them individually\pause
  \item Once you are confident about your final model, measure its
    performance on the test set to estimate the generalization error\pause
  \end{enumerate}
\end{PauseHighLight}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
  \section[-2]{7. Present Your Solution}

\begin{PauseHighLight}\squeeze
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Document what you have done\pause
  \item Create a nice presentation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Make sure you highlight the big picture first\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Explain why your solution achieves the business
    objective\pause
  \item Don’t forget to present interesting points you noticed along
    the way
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Describe what worked and what did not
    \item List your assumptions and your system’s limitations\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful
    visualizations or easy-to-remember statements (e.g., “the median
    income is the number-one predictor of housing prices”)\pause
  \end{enumerate}
\end{PauseHighLight}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Next Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}
\section[-2]{8. Launch}

\begin{PauseHighLight}\squeeze
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Get your solution ready for production (plug into production
    data inputs, write unit tests, etc.)\pause
  \item Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance
    at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to “rot” as data
      evolves
    \item Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g.,
      via a crowd-sourcing service)
    \item Also monitor your inputs’ quality (e.g., a malfunctioning
      sensor sending random values, or another team’s output
      becoming stale). This is particularly important for online
      learning systems\pause
    \end{itemize}
  \item Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate
    as much as possible)\pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{PauseHighLight}

  \item Not everything might be relevant\pause
  \item But there is quite a lot of wisdom, so review the list
    regularly during the project\pause
  \item You are doing this for you!\pause
